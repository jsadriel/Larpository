PROGCON Week 11 - Test Results and Reflection Summary
1. Four Test Arrays and Averages:
   - [22, 9, 0, 17] -> Sum: 48, Count: 4, Average: 12.0
   - [22, 0, 49, 8] -> Sum: 79, Count: 4, Average: 19.75
   - [35, 13, 22, 0] -> Sum: 70, Count: 4, Average: 17.5
   - [10, 5, -4, 27] -> Sum: 38, Count: 4, Average: 9.5
 
2. Correctness Judgments and Reflections:
   - All calculated averages matched the expected manual outputs accurately.
   - The program correctly handled zero values and negative numbers without logic errors.
